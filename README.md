# animoto-trim-mp4
Trim an entire catalog of MP4 files so that they fit Animoto's limit of 400MB

# Description
Animoto only allows you to upload videos of 400 MB, but since you most undoubtedly want these videos, they need to be trimmed down so that you can import them! This script loops through your directory and creates a _.MP4 file for every MP4 file over 400 MB, clipping out the first 4 minutes of the video.

# Usage
Just run the script like it is.

# Dependencies
- Bash
- ffmpeg
